O that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here!

Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join that song,
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood washed throng;

And they praise their great Redeemer who hath said to them, “well done”.

Verse 4:
So, altho’ I’m not an angel, yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus that the angels cannot share;

Freely pardoned my transgression, died to set a sinner free.

Far off from the gates of gold -
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care,
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.

I go to the desert to find My sheep.”

Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

That mark out the mountain’s track?”

Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own.”

Title: THE GREAT JUDGMENT MORNING

Verse 1:
I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright shining angel,
And stood on the land and the sea,
And swore with his hand raised to heaven,
That time was no longer to be.

And O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayer was too late.

The rich man was there, but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgment,
His debts were too heavy to pay;

When death came, was left far behind!
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

Verse 3:
The widow was there with the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven for ever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
And the man that had sold them the drink,
With the people who gave him the license,
Together in hell they did sink.

Verse 4:
The moral man came to the judgment,
But his self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as moral men, too;

No time now to think of religion!”
At last they had found time to die.

For His love unfailing and His tender care?

Trusting the promise “I will not forget thee,”
Onward will I go with songs of joy and praise;
Tho’ earth despise me, tho’ my friends forsake me,
Jesus will be near me gladdening my days.

All my tribulations, all my sorrows past,
How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation:

Verse 3:
Still on and on the anthems spread
Of Hallelujah voices,
In concert with he holy dead
The Warrior-Church rejoices;
Their snow-white robes are washed in blood,
Their golden harps are ringing;
Earth, and the Paradise of God,
One triumph-song are singing.

He comes, whose Advent Trumpet drown
The last of Time’s evangels
Emmanuel crowned with many crowns,
The Lord of saints and angels:
O Life, Light, Love, the Great I AM,
Triune, who changest never;
The throne of God and of the Lamb
Is Thine, and Thine for ever!
